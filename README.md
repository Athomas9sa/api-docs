# Harvard Art Museums API Documentation

The Harvard Art Museums API is a REST-style service designed for developers who wish to explore and integrate the museumsâ€™ collections in their projects. The API provides direct access to [JSON](http://json.org) formatted data that powers the [museums' website](http://www.harvardartmuseums.org) and many other aspects of the museums. 

## Access to the API

All requests to the API begin with: 

```shell
http://api.harvardartmuseums.org
```

The API uses keys to authenticate requests. Every request must be accompanied by the `apikey` parameter and an API key. 

```shell
http://api.harvardartmuseums.org?apikey=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
```

[Send a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Fe1H4nOhFkrLpaeBpLAnSrIMYvcAxnYWm0IU9a6IkFA/viewform) to obtain your key.

## Responses and data format

All data comes out in [JSON](http://json.org) format. Here is a typical response:

```json
{
    "info": {
        "totalrecordsperquery": 10,
        "totalrecords": 224111,
        "pages": 22412,
        "page": 1
    },
    "records": [

    ],
    "facets": [

    ]
}
```

## Paging through data

By default, requests return 10 records at a time. You can increase the number of records per page up to a maximum of 100 by setting the `size` parameter. Use the `page` parameter to page through large record sets.

```shell
http://api.harvardartmuseums.org/object?size=5&page=42
```

## Images

Some of the datasets include URLs to images in JPEG format. Our images are served to you by an image delivery service that is capable of resizing images on the fly. Append `height` and `width` parameters to image URLs to get an image sized to fit to the supplied dimensions. For example, if you want an image scaled to 150 pixels on the longest side construct the URL as follows.

```shell
http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:OCP16703_dynmc?height=150&width=150
```

Please note that URLs for images of objects that have rights restrictions are excluded for most API users. This means images for many 20th and 21st century works of art will not be available to you at the present time. We are working on a solution to this.
