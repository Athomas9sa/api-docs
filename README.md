# Harvard Art Museums API Documentation

The Harvard Art Museums API is a REST-style service designed for developers who wish to explore and integrate the museumsâ€™ collection in their projects. The API provides direct access to JSON formatted data that powers the [museums' website](http://www.harvardartmuseums.org) and many other aspects of the museums. 

## Access to the API

All requests to the API begin with: 

```shell
http://api.harvardartmuseums.org
```

The API uses keys to authenticate requests. Every request must be accompanied by the apikey parameter and an API key. [Send us a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Fe1H4nOhFkrLpaeBpLAnSrIMYvcAxnYWm0IU9a6IkFA/viewform) to obtain your key.
