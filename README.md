# Harvard Art Museums API Documentation

The Harvard Art Museums API is a REST-style service designed for developers who wish to explore and integrate the museumsâ€™ collections in their projects. The API provides direct access to [JSON](http://json.org) formatted data that powers the [museums' website](http://www.harvardartmuseums.org) and many other aspects of the museums. 

## Access to the API

All requests to the API begin with:
